# Falcon Partner Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating Falcon’s promotional ad unit system into your platform. Falcon enables partners to display targeted promotional offers to customers at key moments in their journey (thank you pages, order status pages, etc.).

The integration follows a three-step process:

1. **Create a Publisher** - Represents a store owner/merchant in Falcon’s system
2. **Create a Site** - Represents an individual store/website
3. **Create a Placement** - Represents the specific ad unit location (e.g., thank you page)
