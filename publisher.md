# Bundle publishers

## Key benefits
Being a bundle publisher on the Falcon Protocol means you are able to create
bundles and sell them to consumers. This can be with your own subscription
offering included in the bundle or simply as a way to increase your revenues to
your consumers if you are not a subscription service.

## Purchase management
When selling bundles there are two money flow scenarios:
1. Super bundle - In a super bundle you as the seller act as the single merchant
   in front of consumer. They will pay you and you will collect all money that
   shall be split among the businesses that are included in this bundle
   offering.
2. Soft bundle - In a soft bundle the consumer is receiving the bundle through
   your service but they are paying each merchant separately. This means that
   you only collect directly the revenues associated with your own service.

In either scenario, Falcon Protocol will handle all money state management
between you and the relevant merchants of the bundles. Both collecting and
granting / reimitting commissions to the relevant merchant accoding to the
bundle terms.


## Receiving Commissions
As a bundle merchant you will also be entitled to receive commissions from
merchants for driving new subscribers to their businesses by way of the bundle.
In the opposite path to purchase management, Falcon Protocol will handle all
commission collection and remittance to you as a bundle publisher according to
the terms of the bundle contract

### Retaining commissions or further discounting bundles 
As a bundle publisher you have a choice of action when it comes to the
commissions you receive from merchants.
1. Retain the commission - You can choose to keep the commission as a revenue
   stream for your business.
2. Pass on the commission to the consumer - You can choose to pass on the
   commission to the consumer in the form of a greater discount on the bundle
   offering. This can lead to further increases in the conversion rate of the
   bundle. In this scenario Falcon Protocol will handle the discounting
   calculations and provide this data during the bundle presentation and
   purchase from to the end consumer.
