AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

This agreement describes the terms and conditions for participation in the
Audiobooks.com Affiliate Program. The terms "Affiliate," "you," and "your" are
referring to you, the applicant. "We" and "our" refer to Audiobooks.com. We are
independent parties and this agreement will not form any partnership.

AGREEMENT DURATION

This agreement will begin upon our acceptance of your affiliate application and will
end when terminated by either party. Termination may happen at any time, with
or without cause, by giving the other party written notice of termination.
Termination and/or commissions being withheld may also occur as a result of
failure to comply with the below terms and conditions.

MODIFICATION

By posting a Change Notice or a new agreement on this site, we may modify any of
the terms and conditions within this Agreement at any time and at our sole
discretion. These modifications may include, but not limited to changes in the
scope of available referral fees, fee schedules, payment procedures and Program
rules. If any of the modifications are UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, your only recourse
is to terminate this Agreement. If you CONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN THE
PROGRAM following the posting of a Change Notice or new agreement, it will be
considered as your acceptance of the change.

COMMISSION FEES

Affiliate commissions will only be paid on qualified actions (i.e. free trial signups)
which are made through qualified Affiliates. Commission rates are determined
based on the quality of your leads. Traffic quality is reviewed regularly and rates
are appropriately adjusted when required only. All adjustments are communicated
in advance by the Affiliate Manager. Please allow seven (7) business days before
confirming leads as we routinely deduplicate leads.

All statistics are collected and calculated by Audiobooks.com, and will be the only
valid statistics used for determining Commissions. Commissions will be paid 30
days from month’s end in which minimum payment thresholds are met: $100 for
PayPal or cheque, and $500 for wire. If minimum payment thresholds are not met,
balance rolls over into the following month to accumulate until threshold is met.
Wire transfers require a $30 processing fee, which is deducted from your payment.
All commission payments are made through PayPal.com unless special
arrangements are made for affiliates who do not have access to PayPal.com. You
agree that you are solely responsible for all tax obligations due to all taxing
authorities arising from or in connection with your participation in our Affiliate
Program. Audiobooks.com shall not withhold any taxes of any kind from your
commission checks, provided that the appropriate tax forms are filled out
accordingly.

Depending on your specific circumstances, you’ll need to fill out one of the
following:
• W-9 form if you are a USA taxpayer
• W-8BEN form if you are a foreign individual
• W-8BEN-E if you are a foreign entity/business
You are responsible for researching your situation and ensuring that the
appropriate form for your situation is completed and submitted.

QUALIFIED ACTION PROCESSING

Audiobooks.com will be solely responsible for processing every qualified action
